# Neumorphism Login Form

## Overview

**Neumorphism-Login-Form** is a visually appealing login form built using the Neumorphism (Soft UI) design trend. This project demonstrates how to create a user authentication interface with a soft, extruded plastic look that features subtle shadowing and highlights, providing a modern and tactile user experience.

## Features

- **Neumorphic Design:** Implements the Neumorphism style using advanced CSS, including shadows and gradients, to achieve a soft, 3D look.
- **Responsive Layout:** Fully responsive design adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern UI Elements:**
  - Input fields for username and password, each with icon support (using [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com/)).
  - Prominent login button with interactive hover and active states.
  - Links for "Forgot password?" and "Sign Up" actions.
- **Accessible Markup:** Semantic HTML structure with focus on accessibility and user flow.

## File Structure

- `html/index.html`  
  The main HTML file containing the markup for the login form interface.
- `css/style.css`  
  Contains all styles required for the Neumorphic effect and responsive behavior.
- `js/script.js`  
  Placeholder for any interactive JavaScript (currently empty, ready for extension).

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5:** For semantic structure.
- **CSS3:** For layout, Neumorphic styling, and responsiveness.
- **Boxicons:** For vector icons in input fields.
- **JavaScript:** (Optional, currently no logic implemented).

## UI Details

- The login form is centered both vertically and horizontally.

- Input groups feature icons to visually indicate their purpose.
- All elements use a consistent, subdued color palette for a modern feel.
- Interactive elements (buttons and links) include transitions and hover effects.
